# Image Resize Functionality Fix

## Problem
The image component resize handles in the page builder were not functioning properly. When hovering over an image component, the resize handles would appear but dragging them would not resize the image.

## Solution
I've implemented a complete image resize functionality with the following improvements:

### 1. Created Separate JavaScript File
- **File**: `public/js/image-resize.js`
- Contains all resize-related functions:
  - `addResizeHandles()` - Adds 8 resize handles (corners and sides) to image containers
  - `startResize()` - Handles the mousedown event and initiates resize
  - `getCursorForPosition()` - Returns appropriate cursor style for each handle position

### 2. Updated Builder Page
- **File**: `resources/views/cms/pages/builder.blade.php`
- Added script include for `image-resize.js`
- Enhanced CSS for better handle visibility and user experience

### 3. Key Features

#### Resize Handles
- 8 handles total: 4 corners (nw, ne, sw, se) and 4 sides (n, e, s, w)
- Handles appear on hover with smooth opacity transition
- Larger handles (12px) with white border and shadow for better visibility
- Hover effect scales handles to 1.3x for better interaction feedback

#### Resize Behavior
- Smooth drag-to-resize functionality
- Minimum dimensions enforced (50px x 50px)
- Visual feedback during resize:
  - Dashed blue outline around image
  - Appropriate cursor for each handle direction
  - User selection disabled during resize
- Automatic save to server after resize completes

#### Visual Improvements
- Better handle styling with shadows
- Blue outline during resize operation
- Proper cursor changes based on handle position
- Smooth transitions for all interactions

## How It Works

1. **Initialization**: When the page loads, `addResizeHandles()` is called for all existing image components
2. **New Images**: When a new image is added, resize handles are automatically attached
3. **Resizing**: 
   - User hovers over image → handles appear
   - User clicks and drags a handle → image resizes in real-time
   - User releases mouse → new dimensions are saved to server
4. **Persistence**: Dimensions are stored in component properties and persist across page reloads

## Testing

To test the functionality:
1. Go to the page builder
2. Drag an image component to the canvas
3. Hover over the image - you should see 8 blue circular handles
4. Click and drag any handle to resize the image
5. Release the mouse - the new size should be saved
6. Refresh the page - the image should maintain its resized dimensions

## Technical Details

### CSS Classes
- `.resize-handle` - Base styling for all handles
- `.resize-handle-{position}` - Position-specific styling (nw, ne, sw, se, n, e, s, w)
- `.resizing` - Applied to component wrapper during resize operation
- `.resizable-image-container` - Container for the image with relative positioning

### Event Flow
1. `mousedown` on handle → `startResize()`
2. `mousemove` on document → `doResize()` (updates dimensions)
3. `mouseup` on document → `stopResize()` (saves to server)

### Server Communication
- Endpoint: `PUT /cms/builder/{domainId}/component/{componentId}`
- Payload: `{ properties: { width: '300px', height: '200px', ... } }`
- Response: Updated component data

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Uses standard DOM APIs and CSS3
- No external dependencies beyond what's already in the project
